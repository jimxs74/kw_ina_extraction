keyword extraction is a one of the fundamental techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to implement further text mining applications. In this paper, we introduce an improved text mining technique based on the baseline tfidf and standard textrank. Our proposed technique involves an adjusted version of standard textRank that considers the detection of custom stopwords specific to the obtained dataset and keyword location. We obtained our dataset from a corpus of communication letters between parties involved in a project, so that this technique can represents in a real case implementation for a project management domain Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that the proposed technique improves the performance of the baseline tfidf, with a recall of 0.xx, precision of 0.xx, and an F1 score of 0.xx. It also produces more relevant keywords related to project management in Bahasa Indonesia.
